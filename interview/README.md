# interview

## Setup

Run `npm install`

Run tests with `npm run test`

## Interview Process

### Agenda

1. Each person on our side introduces themselves, then hear about the candidates background
2. One person on our side pairs with the candidate on the technical interview (rules below)
3. Anyone on our side asks questions for 20-30 minutes
4. The candidate asks questions of any of us for 20-30 minutes

### Technical Interview

The goal is to do the best job we can at objectively measuring the candidates technical capability. With that in mind, there are some rules:
- Time limit: 80 minutes. Note the time when the technical portion starts and end at exactly 80 minutes, even if it's in the middle of a task.
- The candidate cannot skip any tasks
- The person designated to pair on our side should do 95% of the talking (aim for 100%, but it's okay to defer to other people in the room for specific questions and help if needed)

Rules and guidelines for the person pairing with the candidate: You can:
- Answer any questions about the test suite set up, how to run tests, etc.
- Answer any questions about Javascript-specific syntax if they clearly know the answer in general. For example, if the candidate says, "I would use this function in X language, how do you do that in Javascript?", then tell them.
- Point out syntax flaws (but not logical flaws). For example, if the candidate is missing a paren, or if they forgot to pass an empty string to `split()`.
- Nudge them if they get stuck, without giving them the answer directly. For example, ask them to walk you through what their code does line by line, or to explain their thought process behind certain things.
You cannot:
- Give them the answer directly.
- Let them skip any tasks.

### Post interview

Prior to discussion, everyone on our side will vote on the candidate from the following options:
- 2 thumbs up: I really like this candidate and we should hire them
- 1 thumb up: I liked them and I'm on board for hiring, but they weren't perfect
- 1 thumb down: I have some reservations, but I wouldn't be upset if they're hired
- 2 thumbs down: We absolutely should not hire this person

After voting, discussion of the candidate is allowed. Two goals with discussion:
1. If everyone is a mix of 1 thumb up / 1 thumb down, discuss to figure out if we should hire them
2. Improve our interview process over time. Anything we can do better?

Your vote is not anonymous, and you'll be asked why you voted the way you did.
